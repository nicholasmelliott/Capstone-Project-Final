# Capstone-Project-Final (Treehouse final project)

A responsive web app that allows users to place an order/s to have new windows or window screens built or restored. The app also allows users to view if their order is complete, view the current weather in their area (to see if their windows can be opened), and view the variety of local insects in their area (to see what they are keeping out). 

The app uses 3 apis:
    MetaWeather.com to get local weather data.
    NatureServe.org to get local insect data.
    Flickr.com to get photos of the local insects. 

Check it out at screenandglassrepair.com.

For production, run npm install then npm start.

*This project was developed in seperate repositories (for front end and backend) and then combined. To view the git history check out the repos: capstone-project-react-client-v1 and capstone-project-react-v1

P.s. for viewing local insects in your area, click the bee icon in the navbar.
